<h1>Introduction</h1>

A planet is a celestial body, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally rounded and has “cleared the neighbourhood” around its orbit.

“I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.”
— Neil Degrasse Tyson

Unfortunately, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, Pluto still deserves full planet hood.

<h1>Mars</h1>

Mars is named after the Roman god of war, it is often described as the “Red Planet” because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
